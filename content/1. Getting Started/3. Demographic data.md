## Demographic data in Telescope

We now have demographic, story-level data for UK readers in Telescope, so you can see how your story is performing with UK youth audiences (18-34) and non-youth audiences (over 35), and male or female readers. Here we explain more about where the data comes from,  what it measures, and how it's useful.

### Where do you get this data from?
We get data on the demographics of our UK website readers from a service called Hitwise. They take a 3m panel of UK internet users who have agreed to have their usage monitored anonymously, and match it against survey data from, for example, Kantar, Experian and Mosaic. They then extrapolate those figures to BBC News readership data. You can read more about their methodology [here](https://www.hitwise.com/gb/methodology/). 

### What does this data cover?
This data covers page views of the BBC News website from readers in the UK. While it includes views on mobile and desktop, it does not include any traffic from the BBC News app, only views on the responsive website on mobile. It also excludes page views from international readers. 

Unfortunately, this data is not available for BBC Sport, Newsround or World Service stories in Telescope - it is limited to BBC News stories only.  

It also does not cover any other metrics such as time spent on the page or recirculation - it only tracks page views from specific audience segments. 

### How often do you get this data?
We get demographic data delivered to us between midnight and 12pm for the previous day's stories. We aim to have this data visible in Telescope that day — so by 12pm latest on a Tuesday you will be able to view demographic data for a story you published on the Monday before. 

### What does this demographics chart data in Telescope show me?
It shows us, for each story published the previous day on BBC News, how many of its UK website readers as a percentage were from the following demographic groups:

* Men
* Women
* Men 18-24
* Women 18-24
* Men 25-34
* Women 25-34
* Men 35-44
* Women 35-44
* Men 45-54
* Women 45-54
* Men 55+
* Women 55+

For simplicity, we group these figures on a Telescope story page as youth (18-34) or non-youth (over 35) readers. For instance, this chart below shows that, for everyone who read this article in the UK on the website, 13.2% were women aged 18-34.

### What does the ‘Youth Report’ filter on the Telescope homepage show me?
This shows the percentage of UK website male and female readers aged 18-34 that read the most popular BBC News stories on the dates selected. So for instance, in the top story in this view below, 30% of its UK website readers over the last seven days were men and women aged 18-34:

Please note the most recent data you can view in this report is for yesterday’s stories, due to the time at which we receive the data from Hitwise, as mentioned above.


### How do I know what good looks like?
The Audiences team have looked at the demographic data to BBC News articles and determined the following:

### Why does this data matter? How can it help me? 
The BBC typically struggles to reach "underserved" audiences, that is men and women under-35, and particularly those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. But it has a public service to reach everyone, and needs to address this decline in reaching these particular audiences. This is where data can help us.

This data lets us measure more accurately which of our specific stories are reaching those underserved readers, and which ones are not. In addition to helping us better track performance with those readers, it gives us more information to help us with our optimisation and future commissionining decisions - i.e. if we have noticed that giving a recurring topic/set of stories a particular treatment performed well with younger audiences, we might want to replicate that treatment on future stories in this topic in order to try and continue to reach those readers.

### Who should I contact for more help?
