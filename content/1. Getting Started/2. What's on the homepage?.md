## What’s on the homepage?
 
The homepage is arranged by a list of 'quick reports' - which are there to help you find the most useful information on story performance as easily as possible. The default quick report is a list of top stories published on BBC News within the last 48 hours, ordered by pageviews for the specific day you've selected.

The other reports are the Youth Report - note this only works for News. This shows the percentage of UK readers aged 18-34 that read the most popular stories on the website (not the app) on the dates selected, regardless of the date they were published. You can read more about this report and where we get demographic data from [on this page](https://telescope-beta.tools.bbc.co.uk/guides/getting-started/demographic-data).

The bottom stories report shows the least popular stories published on the dates selected; top search and top social list the stories that are earning the most clicks from search engines and social networks; and the bottom recirculation report will bring up the stories that have the lowest percentage of readers going on to read another story. 

If you’d like to see traffic for a specific World Service site, you can select one from the **‘News’** drop-down menu at the top of the page:

To change the date you'd like to view stories for, click the 'Today' link. This will bring up a calendar from which you can choose from a list of dates, a specific day, or your own custom range of days:

To view stats for a specific story, just click through on the box the story appears in in the list of items you’ve searched for. Alternatively, you can search for it by putting the story’s CPS ID in the search box in the top right of the page:

If you wish to run a more advanced query, select the 'Advanced' toggle on the right hand side of the page. This will bring up a variety of options, such as the ability to sort the list by traffic source (entry type, mobile or desktop, region), and story type (story page, MAP, live page):
