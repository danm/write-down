## What about recirculation?

The third chart on the page is **'recirculation'**. This shows you the average proportion of the page’s browsers who click away to another piece of content on the site.

As with the other charts on the page, you can see when changes were made to your story, and if they had an effect on the average recirculation rate of the piece. You can see these by hovering over the vertical lines on the chart. (These will by default be switched on, but to turn them off just click the 'show events' slider.

BBC News's average recirculation rate is around 30-40%, but articles should be judged individually. For instance, if many of the page’s visitors are coming from social and search the recirculation rate will be lower, as these users would likely be looking for a specific piece of content, versus direct loyal users who would be browsing the site more broadly. 

And a high recirculation rate on desktop can also mask a lower recirculation rate on mobile, as the right hand side boxes (top stories, features and most read) only appear at the very bottom of the story on mobile. Here is what a story looks like on mobile versus desktop:

**_What does this mean?_** 
Similarly to engagement, recirculation is an important signal for us to pay attention to for creating engaging content and building a loyal audience. It helps us retain new users and turn them into regular visitors, and surface the most relevant content that resonates with our existing readers.
 
 
**_Tips_** 
 
* Again, Chartbeat’s [scroll depth indicator](https://chartbeat.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210240797-Learn-about-Scroll-Depth) is useful here: it will show you where your users are reading up to, which could be a handy place to insert more internal links that are relevant to the story and the reader’s journey. Generally, adding more related links is a good way of boosting recirculation. 
* When adding related links, you don't need to necessarily use the headline as the text you're linking to the piece from—a strong quote works well, too. It's worth thinking about the piece you're adding the link to and why a user is reading it—what motivated them to read this piece, and what else would they be interested in on a similar theme? Use that thinking to inform how you write the link text.  
* The [Heads Up Display](https://chartbeat.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209707967-How-to-install-the-Heads-Up-Display) will also show you which of these internal links are most popular, so you can move them to a more prominent position within the article if needed.
* The right hand side boxes on desktop do not display on mobile—so it’s worth adding inline links to provide more relevant content for mobile users.
