## How much traffic did my content get?
When you open an individual story stats page, you'll see its total number of pageviews, the average time spent on the story, and average recirculation rate. You'll also see its published time, last updated time, word count, CPS ID, and a list of other assets included in the piece (e.g. the number of images, related links, and tags).

You can also expand the **'embedded content'** tab to see which videos, audio files and images the story contains.  And if you think the numbers on the page are incorrect, you can click the **'report this page'** button and we'll investigate it. 

 
Beneath these tabs, the first chart you’ll see once you click through on an article will be the **'page views'** chart. This shows you the total pageviews to the story over time.

You can also see at what points changes were made to your story (e.g. if the main image was replaced for another one, or the headline was tweaked). These will be shown by default with the **‘show events’** slider in the top right corner; this will bring up vertical plots on the chart that correspond with the time changes were made, and by hovering over them you can see exactly what these changes were.

These events will be visible within every tab on these charts. If you wish to hide these, just tap the slider to select **"hide events"**. 

 

**_What does this mean?_**
 
Events are helpful for seeing if traffic was impacted by making those changes to your story. Did the headline change, adding of tags, or change of picture correlate with a growth in pageviews? Or the opposite? Why do you think that was? 
 
**_Tips_** 
 
* The shaded area for the last hour of the charts in Telescope denotes that that hour’s worth of data is incomplete, as it is still coming through from ComScore.
