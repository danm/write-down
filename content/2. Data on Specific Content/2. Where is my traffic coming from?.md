It breaks traffic down into the following sources:

**Entry type:** This will show you which websites or referrers readers came from. The definitions of these are:
 
* **BBC:** This is internal traffic, so readers coming to a page from another BBC page or via the BBC News app.
* **Social:** Traffic from social media referrers. This includes traffic from links sent in emails or messaging apps that we can't track to a specific source, as well as traffic from Facebook Instant Articles.
* **Search:** Traffic from search engines.
* **Other:** Traffic from any other website that isn’t categorised as search, social, or BBC. This includes aggregators like Google News or Flipboard, other news websites, or blogs, Wikipedia pages wnd websites in general.

If you wanted to just see one source of traffic, click on the coloured box with its name, and it will show just this type of traffic:

**Social:** This will show you the social referrers that drove traffic to the story. If a social referrer you’re looking for is not listed here, it’s because it did not drive any traffic to the story.

**_What does this mean?_**
 
This data gives you a clearer picture of how your content is performing. Is it getting a large portion of its traffic from social referrers? Is the search traffic high because your headline answers a question people are asking? 
 
**_Tips_**
* Make sure your story is being promoted where relevant, such as an official BBC social media account or relevant index page.
* Think about where your story might find its audience and what sort of headline would work well for that platform: is it an emotive, human story that would perform well on social media—and does the headline reflect that emotion? Or, is it more of an answer to a question people are asking, and therefore benefit from a search-friendly headline?
