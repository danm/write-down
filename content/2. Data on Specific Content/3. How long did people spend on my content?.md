## How long did people spend on my content?
If you scroll down a story's stats page, you’ll find the second chart: **'engagement'**. This will show you the average time that was spent on your chosen story:
 
 
![The average time readers spent on your story](../images/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-15%20at%2017.21.03.png "Average time spent, engagement")

As with the other charts on the page, you can see when changes were made to your story, and if they had an effect on the average engaged time of the piece. You can see these by hovering over the vertical lines on the chart. These will by default be switched on, but to turn them off just click the 'show events' slider:


![Seeing when changes were made to your story](../images/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-15%20at%2017.22.49.png? "Making changes to your story")


If you want to see more detail about the changes made to your story, just click the 'full event details' link in the red box, which will appear when you hover over the vertical lines in the chart. Doing so will bring up the following box with details:

![More detail on changes made to your story](../images/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-15%20at%2017.22.59.png? "Detail on changes made to your story" )

 **_What does this mean?_**
 
Engagement is an important metric, as it’s key to building a loyal audience. A normal BBC News news story should be reaching between 40-90 seconds' engaged time—although articles should be assessed individually; this may be longer for features, for instance. If engagement is lower than usual for your story, ask yourself: is there anything to do that will keep more people on it? 

**_Tips_** 
 
* Chartbeat’s [Heads Up Display](https://chartbeat.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209707967-How-to-install-the-Heads-Up-Display) is useful here. The scroll depth indicator shows you where users are leaving an article. Is it at a specific point? Why is that? What percentage read to the end of the piece?
* Are there elements of the page that could be moved, or made more accessible so more users are enticed to stay on the page? Can large blocks of text be given sub-headings, for example?
* If your story is performing particularly well with a high average engaged time, make sure that it is being promoted sufficiently on indexes and cross-linked to from other relevant articles.
